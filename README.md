ReportAngular
=============
This tool can be used to create a report of all module dependencies a module has in angularJS. Similarly it can list down all controllers, directives and services that would be listed under that module. 

In a big application, keeping track of all controllers and directives is necessary for reporting purposes.
This project is in a very initial stage. 

Version 0.1

So far the app is able to load the module and list down Module dependencies, Controllers under that module, directives under that module and services under that module.

USAGE
======

Paste The files under dist folder into Your Project root i.e. Web Content folder.

1> Run the file tool.html on your server ( Note : Run your browser with web security turned off, due to cross domain restrictions)

2> In the 'URl' filed, give the whole URL to the Index.html file of your project (Note : index.html can be replaced by any file name, you just need to give the file name where you have loaded all your scripts)

3> Give the module name for which you need to list down the report.

4> Click on 'GO' and see the magic.....

5> Any error occurs an alert would come up! If it does fell free to contact me!

It's really a very initial stage project, I have tested it solely on angularJS but haven't got a chance to run it on projects having multiple liberaries like jQuery,  EXTJS etc.


Felow JS coders are invited for suggestions....
