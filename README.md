reportAngular
=============
This tool can be used to create a report of all module dependencies a module has in angularJS. Similarly it can list down all controllers, directives and services that would be listed under that module. 

In a big application, keeping track of all controllers and directives is necessary for reporting purposes.
This project is in a very initial stage. Would release it's first version soon!!! 

Felow JS coders are invited for suggestions....
